# Cloud_based_Distributed_Sales_Management
Cloud-Based Distributed Sales Analytics &amp; Management System A scalable cloud application that collects sales data from multiple distributed locations, processes it centrally, and provides real-time, role-based analytics dashboards for business decision-making. Built with modern cloud architecture and designed for future ML-driven sales forecasting.


# 📌 Overview
This project is a cloud-based distributed sales analytics and management system designed to collect sales data from multiple geographically distributed stores and users, store it centrally in the cloud, and provide real-time, role-based analytics dashboards for business decision-making.

The system is built as an MVP with a cloud-native architecture and is designed to scale and evolve into an AI-driven analytics platform.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
In many organizations, sales data is generated across multiple locations and systems. These traditional setups face challenges such as:
- Fragmented sales data
- Delayed reporting
- Lack of real-time insights
- Poor scalability
- Limited role-based visibility

This project addresses these problems by centralizing distributed sales data in the cloud and enabling real-time analytics.
